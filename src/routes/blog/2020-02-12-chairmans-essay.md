Over the last few weeks we have worked on our Chairman’s essay. Chairman’s is
one of the most prestigious awards in the FIRST Robotics Competition, it honors
the team that best represents a model for other teams to emulate and best
embodies the mission of FIRST. To participate in Chairman’s a team has to write
an essay, make a video and give a presentation.

In [our essay][essay] you can read about our efforts to spread
FIRST in the netherlands and the impact we have had on our community. We will
continue working on the other aspects of Chairman’s and are excited to share
more in the future.
