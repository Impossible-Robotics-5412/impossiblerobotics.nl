After a few weeks of hard work on our FGC robot, we finally were ready to pack and travel to Dubai for the competitions.

For the last few weeks we have been working on our robot in the garage of a student of ours. When the kit of parts arrived we were really exited to see what we got this year (click [here][unboxing-video] for a video)

After some time we came up with a few ideas for the robot, and we started experimenting with some of them. Eventually we sticked to the idea of an expandable arm that could carry balls to the highest level of the centerpiece.

We hope to meet some great new teams, and wish everyone the best of luck!
