Today we continued working on our robot at the building space of our main sponsor [Victron Energy][victron-site]. After waiting a very long time for our meccanum wheels we decided it probably was the best idea to first assemble the drive train with traction and omniwheels. We also rewired all the cables so now all the cables look a lot better.

We really want to thank [Victron Energy][victron-site] for their hospitality, for using the building space and all the other support!!
