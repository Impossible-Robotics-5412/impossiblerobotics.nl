	<h2>Outreach</h2>

	<p>
		Ever since we started as an FRC team we have been active in outreach.
		Our main goal for outreach is to promote FIRST and STEM for everyone,
		from children to adults. We want to inspire them to learn and show them
		how fun it is.
	</p>

	<p>
		When we go to an event we take as many robots as we can with us. At
		events, we let people control our robots themself. They can stack boxes,
		climb on a bar, shoot balls or just drive around. This let's them really
		experience what robotics is, and it's very effective, especially with
		children. Some children may think that robotics or technology is boring,
		but they soon change their mind when they can actually control one.
	</p>

	<p>
		Even though we're a small team, we try to do as much outreach to
		children as we can. Each year we're attending more events, many of which
		are technology related, like <i>Maak Festival Groningen</i> or
		<i>Zpannend Zernike</i>. We also go to many FIRST related events. In the
		2017-2018 season we went to 2 FLL school finals, 4 regional finals and
		the Benelux finale.
	</p>

	<h3>What we have to offer for events</h3>

	<p>
		Since our start as a FRC team we have been doing a lot of outreach,
		going to different kinds of events. To promote our team, to promote STEM
		and FIRST and to enthuse everyone for technology from children to
		adults.

	<p>
		We mainly do demonstrations with our robots and tell people about us and
		FIRST. We let children control the robots to get the best experience and
		also have a lot of photos and videos to show what we do. We usually use
		a 3D printer to make Lego bricks with our name on them and give these
		out to children.
	</p>

		If you are interested in having us at an event, feel free to
		<Link href="/contact">contact</Link> us. We are looking forward to hearing
		from you!
