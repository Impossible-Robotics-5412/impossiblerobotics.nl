	<h3>What we have to offer for members</h3>

	<img src="/pages/join/travelling.jpg" alt="Our team with their suitcases" />

	<p>
		In our team we, among our other goals, try to create a learning platform
		with multiple schools and studies for our students (and mentors). We try
		to give everyone a chance to do and learn what they want, while also
		giving them an opportunity to try new things. This can for example vary
		from designing, programming and building, to getting experience in
		Media, PR and outreach. Things like organising, planning, teamwork and
		leadership are also a big part of being in a FRC team. Aside from the
		countless things you can learn in a FRC team, you also get a chance to
		see different places and get international friends and contacts.

		If you are interested in joining our team, feel free to
		<Link href="/contact">contact</Link> us. We are looking forward to hearing
		from you!
